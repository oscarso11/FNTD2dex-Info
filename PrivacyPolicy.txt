# Privacy Policy for FNTD2dex Discord Bot
**Last Updated:** 28/01/2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the **FNTD2dex** Discord bot (“the Bot”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects, stores, and uses information when users interact with it.

By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described below.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

The Bot only collects the minimum information necessary for its features to function.

### 1.1 Discord User IDs
We store user IDs to:
- Track each user’s collection
- Handle trades and guesses
- Allow owner-only administrative actions

### 1.2 Server & Channel IDs
We store:
- Server IDs for per-server settings  
- Spawn channel IDs  
- Cooldown timers and spawn timestamps  

This allows the Bot to operate consistently across different servers.

### 1.3 Collection Data
We store information about units that users catch, including:
- Unit name  
- Whether the unit is shiny  

Stored in `collections.json`.

### 1.4 Server Settings
We store server-specific configuration such as:
- Spawn channel  
- Cooldown duration  
- Time until next spawn  
- Last spawn timestamps  

Stored in `server_settings.json`.

### 1.5 No Message Content Storage
Although the Bot analyzes messages for spam-like patterns and spawn triggers,  
**it does not store, log, or save message contents**.

All message scanning is temporary and instantly discarded.

---

## 2. How We Use Collected Information

Information is used solely for:
- Spawning units
- Tracking user collections
- Handling trades
- Maintaining per-server settings
- Allowing owner-only administrative functions

No collected data is used for advertising, analytics, or profiling.

---

## 3. How Data Is Stored

We store data in local JSON files:
- `collections.json`  
- `server_settings.json`  
- `dex.json` (unit definitions)

No external databases or third-party storage services are used.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We **do not**:
- Sell data  
- Share data with third parties  
- Transfer data outside the environment the Bot runs on  

Only the **bot owner** has access to stored data.

---

## 5. Data Removal (OWNER ONLY)

Users cannot remove their own data through automated means.

All data deletion actions are **owner-only** and must be performed manually or via the following owner commands:

- `/resetdata <user>` — Removes a specific user’s collection in the server  
- `/globalresetdata` — Removes **all** stored collections globally  

Users must contact the bot owner if they want their data removed.  
The owner has full control over whether data is deleted.

---

## 6. Security Practices

- The Bot stores only non-sensitive information  
- No real names, emails, IP addresses, or message logs are collected  
- Data is stored locally and not transferred externally  

---

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time.  
The “Last Updated” date will always reflect the latest revision.

---

## 8. Contact

To request data removal or ask questions, contact the Bot owner:

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time.  
Continued use of FNTD2dex means you agree to the updated policy.
